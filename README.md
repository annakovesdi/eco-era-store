<h2>Features</h2>

*Header/Footer* 

The header is featured on every page, consisting of several links and dropdown menu's for easy and fast navigation. The accounts dropdown allowes the user to navigate login/profile page functionality while the various links take you to categories (and their products), all products or information on the shop. There is a shoppingcart (displaying the grand total) visible at all times in the header.
The footer has a copyright notice, contact information and instagram and facebook links.  

*Index page* 

The home page features an advertisement video of Eco Era that autoplays and loops, muted. The logo is displayed, big and in the center, with a shop now button (taking you to an all  products page). Under the video you see a peekaboo announcing Eco era on socials - when scrolled the instagram entries of Eco Era Shop are displayed through Juicy. 
The home page has the navigation bar and footer. 

*Products*

All products displays all products (so all categories). Depending on screen size 1 up untill 4 products are displayed in a row. They all have an add to bag button that adds one item to the shoppingbag. 
When the see more button is clicked, products all have an individual page where more information is displayed - their description, picture(s), category, price and eventual combination discounts. Here the quantity is selectable before adding to the bag. 

*Categories*

Every category has a link in the nav-bar and an own page - with the description of the category as the first section. All products can be added to a category. There are 15 categories, all their descriptions are editable by a superuser.

*Profile*

Every user can create a profile, where data on the user is stored, like address and order history. The user can sign up, view their profile, edit their profile and log in and out.

*Superuser*

A superuser can add, edit and delete all products in the webshop - They can change their names, categories, prices, images and descriptions. 
They can edit the discription of categories aswell. 

*Shoppingbag*

The shoppingbag features all products (if there are any) with a picture, name, price, changeable quantity, subtotal and delete button. Also the delivery costs and grand total are displayed, and the free delivery threshold - if it's not reached yet. 

*Checkout*

The checkout page features a form, with delivery and billing information to fill in. If a user is logged in and chose to save this information, it is automatically displayed. Checkout is handled by Stripe, after a successful payment the completed order is displayed with an assigned order number. 

*Toasts*

All actions that a user takes are communicated through toasts. For example if a user succesfully creates a profile/adds a product to the bag etc, a success message is displayed. If a superuser starts editing a product, an information toast of the edit appears. If a user fails to pay due to a mistake in the form, an error message communicates this. 

Features to implement in the future:
Oh so many, so many.

<h2>Technologies used</h2>

Html, Css, JavaScript and Python are the developing languages

Frameworks: Django as the main framework for the site, Bootstrap for CSS, JQery for JavaScript

Libraries and packages used: boto3, coverage, dj-database-url, django-allauth, django-countries, django-crispy-forms, django-storages, gunicorn, jmespath, oauthlib, Pillow, psycopg2-binary, stripe

Balsamiq for the wireframes
lambdatest.com for static testing
Chrome dev tools for manual testing

<h2>Testing</h2>
Testing information can be found in the TESTING.md file

<h2>Deployment</h2>
The site is deployed through Heroku, with staticfiles stored in Amazon Web Services and code version control and storage in GitHub.

Steps to setup deployment:

Create a new Heroku app. 

In the settings of the Heroku app in the browser Config vars are added. Here you add the SECRET_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, DATABASE_URL, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET and USE_AWS configuration variables. 

The SECRET_KEY is the Django secret key variable. 
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are provided in your Amazon Web Services dashboard, where the static files are stored for this site. 
DATABASE_URL is the Postgres url (...............)
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET are provided in the Stripe for developers area in your Stripe profile. 
USE_AWS is set to true (USE_AWS=True) in the Heroku enviroment

Before deploying to Heroku a Procfile (Heroku apps include a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. You can use a Procfile to declare a variety of process types, including: your appâ€™s web server, multiple types of worker processes, a singleton process, such as a clock or tasks to run before a new release is deployed Each dyno in your app belongs to one of the declared process types, and it executes the startup command associated with that process type. The Procfile is always a simple text file that is named Procfile without a file extension) and requirements.txt file are neccesary. They are present in this project. When forking the GitHub be sure to install everything from the requirements.txt file before deploying(just run $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt in your terminal). 

Under the Depoly tab of the Heroku app in the browser it is possible to connect a GitHub Repository to the Heroku app, and automatically deploy from the main branch. In this case every push to main will deploy a new version of this app. Deploys happen automatically: be sure that this branch in GitHub is always in a deployable state and any tests have passed before you push.

Be sure to create a .gitignore file that hides sensitive information from deployment. Always check with $ git status that your sensitive files are not pushed to GitHub and Heroku. A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

The site is now live at https://eco-era-store.herokuapp.com/

Credits
Most of the credits this learning season go to Code Institute. By reviewing the mini-projects I created a lot of this site. Of course, there were lots of other helpers too. They are listed here in no particular order.

Read the book "A smarter way to learn Python" by Mark Myers
Documentation Django
Documentation Bootstrap
Tutors helping along the way. most times i solved the issues myself after being helped on the way by a tutor. Tutor help was contacted lot's of times throughout my project.
